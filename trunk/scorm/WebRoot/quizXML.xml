<Feedback>Incorrect - Although your natural instinct is to look over your shoulder to judge a person’s distance from you, this could encourage a confrontation with a potential attacker. It is more advisable to take a less confrontational approach such as crossing the road to see if the person follows.  If so you could take refuge in a more public place or catch a licensed taxi home.</Feedback></Answer><Answer AnswerID="2" Correct="1" Score="10" Order="2" TaskSeverity="10" ActionByID="0"><Text>No</Text><TaskName></TaskName><TaskDescription></TaskDescription><Feedback>Correct Answer</Feedback></Answer></Answers></Question><Question QuestionID="MI14" QuestionType="exam" Title="Question 2" CommentBox="0" qType="MC"><Text>When walking home alone at night, which one of the following statements is true?</Text><Answers><Answer AnswerID="1" Correct="1" Score="10" Order="1" TaskSeverity="10" ActionByID="0"><Text>You should walk home facing towards the traffic </Text><TaskName /><TaskDescription /><Feedback>Correct Answer</Feedback></Answer><Answer AnswerID="2" Correct="0" Score="0" Order="2" TaskSeverity="0" ActionByID="0"><Text>You should walk home facing away from the traffic </Text><TaskName /><TaskDescription /><Feedback>Incorrect - Try to walk facing the traffic where possible, thus enabling drivers to have a clear view of you, and for you to see them.</Feedback></Answer></Answers></Question><Question QuestionID="MI15" QuestionType="exam" Title="Question 3" CommentBox="0" qType="MC"><Text>Where is it recommended that you keep your emergency taxi fare?</Text><Answers><Answer AnswerID="1" Correct="0" Score="0" Order="1" TaskSeverity="0" ActionByID="0"><Text>In your Wallet</Text><TaskName></TaskName><TaskDescription></TaskDescription><Feedback>Incorrect - Always keep an emergency taxi fare in a separate location from your wallet.
